Justin has been a fantastic addition to our team for the last 4 months.  Due to Justin's skills and abilities we asked that he take on some additional responsibilites throughout the term, namely Automation.  Justin was able to provide both a great testing ability and contribute to our Automation code base.  His enthusiasm and desire to learn helped push the Automation team to develop more internal processes and develop more reliable code. Justin's hard work and good attitude truly added to our team dynamic and helped make Kik a fun place to work and I would gladly work with Justin in the future. Best of luck!
